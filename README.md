Questions

1. Square Root of a Number
        ◦ Given an integer x, find square root of it. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(√x).
        ◦ solution : [sqrntnum.cpp](https://github.com/LearningMonkey61/DAA/blob/master/sqrntnum.cpp)

2. Missing Number in Arithmetic Progression
        ◦ Given an array that represents elements of arithmetic progression in order, one element is missing in the progression, which you need to find.
        ◦ solution : [apcompletion.cpp](https://github.com/LearningMonkey61/DAA/blob/master/apcompletion.cpp)

3. Number of days after which tank will become empty
        ◦ Given a tank with capacity C litres which is completely filled in starting, every day the tank is filled with l litres of water and in the case of overflow extra water is thrown out. Now on i-th day, ‘i’ litres of water is taken out for drinking. We need to find out the day at which tank will become empty the first time.

4. Longest Common Prefix
        ◦ Given a set of strings, find the longest common prefix.
        ◦ solution : [longestprefix.cpp](https://github.com/LearningMonkey61/DAA/blob/master/longestprefix.cpp)

5. The Skyline Problem
        ◦ Given n rectangular buildings in a 2-dimensional city, computes the skyline of these buildings, eliminating hidden lines. The main task is to view buildings from a side and remove all sections that are not visible.
        ◦ All buildings share common bottom and every building is represented by triplet (left, ht, right)
        ◦ ‘left’: is x coordinated of left side (or wall).
        ◦ ‘right’: is x coordinate of right side
        ◦ ‘ht’: is height of building.
        ◦ A skyline is a collection of rectangular strips. A rectangular strip is represented as a pair (left, ht) where left is x coordinate of left side of strip and ht is height of strip.
        ◦ solution : [skyline.cpp](https://github.com/LearningMonkey61/DAA/blob/master/skyline.cpp)
